# Hometown Homepage

This is a project from the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path. The project is to create a homepage for our hometown. The project is to be completed using HTML and CSS.

## Project Requirements
- View the design file given: [Figma Design](requirements_starter_files/design_requirement_preview.png) (also below this section)
- Starter HTML given: [index.html](requirements_starter_files/index.html)
- Starter CSS given [styles.css](requirements_starter_files/styles.css)

As you will see, not much has been done in the starter files, just the basic structure of the HTML and some basic styling in the CSS.

Here is a screenshot of the **design requirement**:

## What I did

- Used ChatGPT to generate the text content and images for the project (no reason to focus on non-programming tedious stuff currently).
- Redesigned the provided Figma design to make it more visually appealing and have all the content I was planning on implementing ([see image here](design_image.png), also, [see original figma file here](design_file.fig)).
- Implemented the new design in the HTML and CSS files.
- Adjusted some styling to make it look a little better toward the end of implementation.
- **Added responsiveness to the homepage.** This was not required at all, but I wanted to get some practice with it.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **Figma**: Used as the design reference.
- **Responsive Design**: To make the website adaptable across different screen sizes.
