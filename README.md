# Scrimba Projects

This repository contains various guided projects completed as part of the **Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path**. Each project demonstrates the application of core frontend development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Repository Update (early 2025)

In this repository I was originally combining all my Scrimba projects into one repo. However, with React now, I think it will be a better idea to have a separate repository for each project going forward. Therefore, this repo will not be updated anymore.

**Thus, the stuff in this repo are all the projects up until the Advanced React module.**

  - Uncompleted project, may come back later to rebuild with React. Made most of the mobile layout, and did not start on tablet and desktop layouts. (I understand how to do this part, just too much time and effort for a project that I don't plan to use and want to move on in the course to get to the more interesting tools to use for my projects, like **tailwindcss, react, etc.**)
  - Focus: Mobile-first design, responsive layout, and CSS grid. Also, played around with breaking the project up into smaller components.

- [Assembly Endgame](assembly-endgame)

  - Live Demo: [click here](https://assembly-endgame.jasony.dev)
  - A simple hangman game built using React.
