# Basketball Scoreboard

This is one of the early on projects on Scrimba for javascript. We were given a design file with a basketball scoreboard and we had to recreate it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make it interactive.

See the design file here: [Design File](./design-file.png)

Although a simple project, it was a good introduction to using javascript to update the DOM and make the app interactive. Can't wait to progress further through the course and start working on more complex projects.

## What I added

- I used javascript functions for the onclick event listeners that passed parameters to the functions to update the score.
- Responsive design for smaller screen sizes. The app will display the score in a vertical layout for smaller screens.

## Live Demo
