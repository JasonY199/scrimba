# Restaurant Menu App

This is a simple restaurant menu app for Jimmy's Dinner. The app was built to practice some new JS skills I've recently learned, such as map, filter, and reduce. Also I used datasets to store the menu items and prices, and then used the data to create the menu items dynamically.

The app isn't 100% finished yet, but I'm happy with the progress I've made so far. In the future, I may come back to this project to add a more detailed checkout process, but I got the practice I was hoping for with this project, and am ready to move one to more complex and interesting projects in the course.
